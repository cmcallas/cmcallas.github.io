        <h3 class="subtitle">THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY</h3>
        <p class="info">DriveVoya is an app that incentivizes attentive driving by rewarding
                        students and community members for staying off their phones while on
                        the road. DriveVoya came to us with a beta version of their app and a
                        simple, single page website. They needed a way to capture the attention
                        of primary stakeholders in order to further develop their app.</p>

        <ul class="list" id="list3">
          <li class="data"><i class="bold">&#9679; Sponsors -&nbsp</i>individuals and companies that are going to be paying money to sponsor a school's fundraising efforts</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="info"><i class="bold">Secondary Users:&nbsp</i>Parents/Community Members and Students<br />
        While these are the primary users of the DriveVoya app, I determined that parents, community members,
        and students would be accessing the DriveVoya Website far less frequently than sponsors, vendors, and
        school administrators.</p>

                          are the same:</p>
          <ul class="list" id="list4">
            <li class="data"><i class="bold">&#9679; &nbsp</i>They hate having to dig around through multiple pages for the information &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat they need</li>

            <li class="data"><i class="bold">&#9679; &nbsp</i>They want to talk with a real person before their respective schools, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbusinesses, and companies can get involved with any particular school &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfundraisers</li>
