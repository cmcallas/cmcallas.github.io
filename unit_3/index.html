	<h1>Year of the Horse</h1>
	<h3>C Samuel Rees</h3>
	<p>In fourth grade they told me I was<br>
	a horse by blood & the Chinese <br>
	calendar. I wanted to be a snake,<br>
	like my best friend. I wanted more<br>
	than hooves & Westerns & Grecian <br>
	traps, to been unnoticed & feared<br>
	all at once. I wanted to take the world<br>
	in my mouth, ratchet it in slow degrees<br>
	down my throat. To be rogue taxidermy.<br>
	A boy flat as a copperhead stretched<br>
	across to a two-by-four. Coveted<br>
	for its venom, but avoided. Children<br>
	know things like animals know things.<br>
	They both rest on the thin ligament holding<br>
	them apart from humanhood, cognizance.<br>
	I loved my best friend, wanted to be<br>
	what he was, wear scales with his<br>
	coloring upon them. Take his tail<br>
	in my mouth & work to close<br>
	the circle, cinch ourselves away <br>
	from the predator saints of the world.<br>
	Even death is a tactic. I forgot my <br>
	baby teeth eventually, how they <br>
	rattled my mouth piping bad news<br>
	& poetry in as if by tinny speakers<br>
	tuned to unavoidable, invisible cisterns<br>
	of knowledge. In fifth grade I learned<br>
	about the horses of Diomedes. <br>
	Shivered over their hunger. <br>
	How they ate the dear world, its<br>
	thoughtless apes. I did not care<br>
	that they were a plot point in a<br>
	psychotic heroâ€™s story. I was<br>
	by blood a man-eating horse<br>
	& any hand which pet me<br>
	would disappear into my<br>
	infinite gullet.</p>
